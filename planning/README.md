# Planning for FREE YOUR BIO

## What it is

Follow Me is an app that allows users to make a page where someone with the link can view all their social media links.

## Problem it solves

Have you ever seen someones social media bio?
Often bios look like this:  
"Add me on snap:  
Insta:  
Facebook/Twitter/YouTube:  
etc.  
Some words...[Out of characters can't write about myself]"

My app aims to turn your bio from that mess that takes up all the space to write about yourself into a single link. Most social medias even include a website link spot so you can totally free your bio. #FreeYourBio
